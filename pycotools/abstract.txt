COPASI is a free-open source software package which provides various facilities for building dynamic models of biochemical networks. COPASI is primarily intended to be used via a 'point-and-click' interface which vastly enhances usability at the cost of reducing the speed of setting up modelling tasks. Pycotools is a Python package that automates the configuration and execution of a subset of COPASI tasks.  Pycotools enables the retrieval of model variables from a Python environement, the running of a deterministic time course, enables arbitrary parameter scans to be performed and the configuration of COPASI parameter estimations from within a Python environment. Repetitive procedures such as calculating the profile likelihood method of identifiability analysis, systematically configuring COPASI to fit data to multiple model candidates and increasing parameter estimation throughput are implemented. Tools are provided to implement custom and reusable COPASI workflows and to quickly visualize parameter estimation data. Use of Pycotools features are demonstrated using a well established dynamic model of mitogen-activated (MAPK) signalling. Pycotools is downloadable from pip using the command 'pip install Pycotools', directly from PyPI (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pycotools) or from GitHub (https://github.com/CiaranWelsh/Pycotools).
