Package was developed by ciaran welsh (c.welsh2@newcastle.ac.uk) from Newcastle University, UK. 

copasiAPI is a set of python classes for interfacing with copasi via python
PEAnalysis provides a set of classes for analysing PE data. The code works but is still unfinished. In particular 
the code style is inconsistant with the style of the other classes. This is because the other classes are new and the PEAnalysis class will be adopting the new style asap. 
pydentify2 is a revised version of pydentify and was completly re-written from the bottom. The major differences are
that while pydentify worked, there was a lot of pre-configurations that was left to the user. Pydentify2 automates everyting. 

Other modules will be provided in the future as well as additional classes and features of the copasiAPI such as scan cisualization or steady state task. 

Any questions feel free to email me and I'll try and respond.
